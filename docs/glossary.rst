   Buildout
    
     `Buildout <http://www.buildout.org>`_ is a Python-based build system for creating, assembling and deploying applications
     from multiple parts, some of which may be non-Python-based. It lets you create a buildout
     configuration and reproduce the same software later.
     
     By using it, you don't have to care about a specific package or dependency beeing available
     on your platform. It also isolates the installation from other software.

   Pyramid
   
     The web framework VoteIT is built on. Check out the great documentation at:
     `<http://docs.pylonsproject.org>`_

     Package to create an isolated Python environment.
