   Buildout

    `Buildout <http://www.buildout.org>`_ is a Python-based build system for creating, assembling and deploying applications
    from multiple parts, some of which may be non-Python-based. It lets you create a buildout
    configuration and reproduce the same software later.

    By using it, you don't have to care about a specific package or dependency beeing available
    on your platform. It also isolates the installation from other software.
