Introduction - what is VoteIT
=============================

VoteIT is the web tool to help you host your democratic and participatory
meetings online. VoteIT keeps agenda, discussion, proposals and polls gathered
in a sleek and simple interface. The participants choose their own facilitator
or moderator for the meeting who keeps everything in order and sets up new
agenda items or polls when the meeting needs them.

VoteIT is a free and open source project and is free to download from GitHub
to run on your own server. The project began in 2009 when the Swedish gaming
federation (Sverok) was granted the first of two €100 000 grants from the
Swedish Inheritance Fund. This first part of the project was completed in the
fall of 2011 with the mote.voteit.se website going live. On the site we can
now host organisation’s meetings for free.

Who is behind VoteIT
--------------------

There are several different organisations who have participated in creating
and are involved in further developing VoteIT. Sverok and Betahaus began
the work in 2009 and in the last months of 2011 a new not-for profit
organisation was formed – VoteIT.

VoteIT’s founding members are - in alphabetical order:

* Astma- och allergiförbundet
* `Betahaus <http://www.betahaus.net>`_
* Cesam
* DemoEX
* FFKP
* Moks
* Sveriges föreningar
* Sverok
* Studiefrämjandet
* Ung Webbradio.

These organisations, and many more, are committed to spread,
develop and use VoteIT as a tool for improved democracy and easier participation.
