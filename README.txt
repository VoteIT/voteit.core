Introduction
============

VoteIT is a tool for creating online meetings.
It's meant for decision making processes similar to large scale meetings of NGOs.

There's no release on PyPI yet, and we're still making changes in the code.
If you want to try it out but don't want to install it yourself,
go to http://voteit-dev.betahaus.net or contact the development team.
